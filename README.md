# Structural Bioinformatics

Useful tools for working with protein structures.

## Jupyter Notebooks

[Biopython for working with PDB files](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kluwik/structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/Biopython_for_working_with_PDB_files.ipynb) - standard routine with PDB structures (download from PDB, open/save structures, parse sections, retrieve sequence).

[Molecular graphics in Jupyter](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kluwik/structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/Molecular_graphics_in_Jupyter.ipynb) - static and interactive visualization of protein structures in Jupyter.

[DSSP in Biopython](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kluwik/structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/DSSP_Biopython.ipynb) - get/parse DSSP annotation using Biopython with or without DSSP installed.
